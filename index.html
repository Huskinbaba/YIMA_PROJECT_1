              <h3>History of Wood</h3>
              <p>Wood is one of the longest standing building materials in existence, with evidence showing homes built over 10,000 years ago used timber as a primary source for construction materials. Europe's Neolithic long house--a long, narrow timber dwelling built in 6000 BC-- is an excellent example.</p>

              <h3>Wood Presevatives</h3>
              <p>Methods of applying preservatives to timber
                Methods discussed include brushing and spreading, spraying, deluging and fogging, immersion, hot and cold steeping in open tanks, diffusion, pressure impregnation, and double vacuum. Advises on condition of timber prior to treatment and on the safe use of preservatives.</p>

              <h3>Wood seasoming</h3>
              <p>Seasoning is the process of drying timber to remove the bound moisture contained in walls of wood cells, producing a new product called "seasoned timber." Seasoning can be achieved in a number of ways, but all methods aim to remove water at a uniform rate to prevent damage to the wood during drying (seasoning degrade)</p>

                <h3>Wood data sheet</h3>
                <p>The species database will help you choose the most suitable wood species for your project.It contains the physical properties and illustrations of more than 150 commercial species, reproduced from the popular TRADA Red Books and Wood Information Sheets.The way that the original log has been cut at the saw mill determines the strength and use of the final product. The main 3 types of milling processes are Plain , Quarter and Rift sawn.Hardwoods are usually Plain or Quarter sawn and construction softwoods are generally Rift sawn. In a modern computer driven saw mill a softwood log will be processed in many different ways to maximise the yield from the log.</p>

              <p>The type of wood you choose determines the beauty and strength of the finished piece. Many types of wood are available from Oxford Wood Recycling and each has its own characteristics and properties. Here we try to explain wood, how it is cut, what to expect from different species and how to choose the best wood for your project</p>
